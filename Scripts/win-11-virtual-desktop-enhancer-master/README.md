# Windows 11 Virtual Desktop Enhancer

FORK of [windows-desktop-switcher](https://github.com/sdias/win-10-virtual-desktop-enhancer). 
I just replaced [VirtualDesktopAccessor.dll](https://github.com/Ciantic/VirtualDesktopAccessor) for [latest version](https://github.com/skottmckay/VirtualDesktopAccessor). Now we can use same functionality on Windows 11, wow!

- Customizable keyboard shortcuts to pin a window or a program to all desktops
- Setting a custom wallpaper for each virtual desktop (either a picture or a solid color)
